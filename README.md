 - If your avatar already has an Expression Menu and Parameters set up, simply add LeftThumb and RightThumb ***(CASE SENSITIVE)*** to your avatar's parameters. Nothing needs to be added to your Menu component.

 - If your avatar doesn't have an Expression Menu and Parameters set up, you can use the ones found within your ASL Gestures folder: ASL Params and Blank Menu. These options are found near the bottom of your Avatar Descriptor.

# Control Scheme
 - The provided gesture setup is as follows:

   | Hand Position | Thumb Position | Resulting Shape
   | ------------- | -------------- | --------------- |
   | V Hand        | Thumbstick     | K Hand          |
   | V Hand        | A Button       | R Hand          |
   | V Hand        | B Button       | V Hand          |
   | V Hand        | Trackpad       | U Hand          |
   | Fist          | B Button       | Flat O Hand     |
   | Fist          | Trackpad       | S Hand          |

 - **Also important to note: Enabling Gesture Lock will mess with your ability to use these additional handshapes!
